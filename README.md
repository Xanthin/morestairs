morestairs
==========

Mod for minetest that adds more stairs/slabs from the default game nodes (like glass, mese, dirt, ...)
and corners to connect stairs at an angle.

I used the init.lua file from stairs mod from minetest_game\mods\stairs and added the new blocks.

The idea for the corners comes from the Xanadu Server where I saw them. To add the corners in the code I used the node box editor by rubenwardy to understand the different nodebox values.
